# Kevin Holesh's Letterpress Theme for Tumblr with support for Pages

Letterpress is a really nice theme for [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com "Tumblr") that I like very much and use. It didn't support [Pages](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/424853767/pages "Tumblr Pages"), so I added support for them.

## Differences from the original

* Pages are added to the left of the top navigation bar.
* Timestamp information ("Posted at...") is only printed if a timestamp is available for a Post. This applies to Pages as Pages are essentially Posts without a timestamp.

## Thanks

A shout out to Kevin, Github and Tumblr!
